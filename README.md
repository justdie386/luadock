Sorry, this project is dead, i just hadn't corretly made up my mind on what it would be able to do exactly, and it just got out of control, bad scaling i guess, it should be usable on linux tho, but no real point on doing so

Might make a re-write during christmas time tho, who knows
EDIT: Nevermind, i'll re-write it in a compiled language instead, will be much more practical to distribute, and deal with other issues
